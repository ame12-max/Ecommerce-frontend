Perfect ✅ — a single SELECT with joins will give you the full order summary, ready to plug into your GET API later. Here’s a clean query:

SELECT 
    o.id AS order_id,
    o.created_at AS order_date,
    o.status,
    u.name AS customer_name,
    u.email AS customer_email,
    p.name AS product_name,
    p.description AS product_description,
    oi.quantity,
    oi.price,
    c.name AS category_name
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
WHERE o.id = 1;

🔎 What this gives you

For order_id = 1 (Alice’s order), you’ll see:

Order info → ID, date, status

User info → name + email

Product info → name + description

Category → like Electronics

Order item info → quantity + price

🧾 Example result
order_id	order_date	status	customer_name	customer_email	product_name	quantity	price	category_name
1	2025-09-20 10:15:00	pending	Alice Doe	alice@example.com
	Smartphone X1	2	599.99	Electronics

⚖️ Devil’s advocate:
This query is great for “order details”, but if you’ll use it in production:

Add pagination if fetching many orders.

Pre-calculate totals (SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price)).

Index user_id and order_id for speed.
